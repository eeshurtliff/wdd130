      <p>
        New Home Design
Here are the steps we will take to help you design your new home:
Steps to the process:
1. Make a list of required features and things that would be nice to have 
OR
Find plans you want to model or plan after.
2. Have a size estimate you want to keep your house at.
3. Meet with Elise to talk about your plans and get started.  A $500 deposit is required and will be applied to the final balance when you receive finished plans.
4. We will send you a draft in a few days for you to look over and make changes to.
    - Changes are good!  The goal is to create the best home for you, let us know what you really want.
    - This might take a few iterations, this is okay, and I promise we will get there.
5.  Finish the plans and create a site plan if you have your lot.
6. Send Plans to multiple builders for bids.
7. If you have changes after talking to builders that is okay, I am happy to help you make changes (included in the original price, unless significant changes are made).
8. Send your plans to an engineer if needed, get a permit, and start building.
