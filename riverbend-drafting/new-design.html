                        <li>
                            We will send you a draft in a few days for you to look over and make changes to. 
                            - Changes are good! The goal is to create the best home for you, let us know what you really want.
                            - This might take a few iterations, this is okay, and I promise we will get there. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finish the plans and create a site plan if you have your lot.
