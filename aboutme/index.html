        HI! I am from Idaho Falls, Idaho, but five years ago I lived in Massachusetts.
       I am excited to learn here at BYU-I.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I hope to persue a career 
        where I can merge computer science with my love of art.
    </p>
    <p>I love to play tennis and draw.</p>
    <p>I am the oldest of 6 kids in my family.</p>
    <p>I do not currently have a career or job. I used to work for Hobby Lobby during highschool.</p>
    <p>Knowing how to design a website is a good skill to have, because it gives people a chance to express ideas and show products in a different way.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for my entire life.</p>
    <p>My Favorite quote: "Good timber does not grow with ease. The stronger the wind, the stronger the trees." President Monson</p>
    <p>My Favorite scripture: Alma 58:40</p>
